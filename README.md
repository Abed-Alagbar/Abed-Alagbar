I am an open-minded individual, who is continually looking to improve and eager to support others as I build a career that combines my quantitative and qualitative skills. With a commercial background and spending 5+ years in the market observing different kinds of problems and how they are solved, I developed an interest in Data Engineering. This led me to choose the most expert bootcamp in this field, to allow me to combine my previous experience in business with data engineering.
I want to start my career as a Junior Data Engineering and continually improve my skills by finding a company to collaborate and work with.‚ú®üòç
